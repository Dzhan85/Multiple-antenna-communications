    "# Capacity of Point-to-Point SIMO and MISO channels\n",
    "[Video Lecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ1e_0sIJRk&list=TLPQMTgwNDIwMjAzuG7e4o1Wlw&index=1)\n",
    "## Single Input Single Output (SISO) channel\n",
    "Consider the basic SISO channel model in which the received signal\n",
    "$y = g*x+n$, where $g$ is channel  response, $x$ is the\n",
    "transmitted signal with $q$ energy per symbol, and $n$ is channel noise with\n",
    "variance $N_0$. The channel capacity $C$:\n",
    "$$C=log_2\\left(1+\\frac{q|g|^2}{N_0}\\right) \\text{ bit/symbol.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) channel\n",
    "We consider the channel with one transmit antenna and $M$ receive\n",
    "antennas, and the information signal $x$.\n",
    "- Received at antenna 1: $y_1 = g_1x+n_1$\n",
    "- Received at antenna 2: $y_2 = g_2x+n_2$\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- Received at antenna M: $y_M = g_Mx+n_M$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's convenient to present the channel using vectors. Let's create the\n",
    "received signal vector\n",
    "$\\mathbf{y}= \\left[ \\begin{matrix}\n",
    "  y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_M\n",
    "\\end{matrix} \\right]$, the channel vector\n",
    "$\\mathbf{g}= \\left[ \\begin{matrix}\n",
    "  g_1 \\\\ g_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ g_M\n",
    "\\end{matrix} \\right]$, and the noise vector\n",
    "$\\mathbf{n}= \\left[ \\begin{matrix}\n",
    "  n_1 \\\\ n_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ n_M\n",
    "\\end{matrix} \\right]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the received signal vector can be written as:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{g}x + \\mathbf{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to project the received signal vector onto channel vector, we\n",
    "create the length-one version of channel vector:\n",
    "$\\mathbf{v}=\\frac{\\mathbf{g}}{||\\mathbf{g}||}$ ($||\\mathbf{g}||$ is the\n",
    "norm of vector $\\mathbf{g}$), and take the inner product:\n",
    "$\\mathbf{v}^H\\mathbf{y}=\\frac{\\mathbf{g}^H\\mathbf{y}}{||\\mathbf{g}||}$.\n",
    "This projection process is called Maximum combining and the vector\n",
    " $\\mathbf{v}=\\frac{\\mathbf{g}}{||\\mathbf{g}||}$ is called the Maximum\n",
    " Ratio Combining (MRC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scalar received signal: $\\mathbf{v}^H\\mathbf{y} =\n",
    "  \\mathbf{||g||}x + \\mathbf{v}^H\\mathbf{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the SIMO channel capacity is:\n",
    "$$log_2\\left(1+\\frac{q||\\mathbf{g}||^2}{N_0}\\right)\\text{ bit/symbol.}$$\n",
    "## Multi Input Single Output (MISO) channel\n",
    "We consider the channel with $M$ transmit antennas and one receive\n",
    "antennas, and each antenna transmits the one information signal of\n",
    "$[x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_M]$.\n",
    "In vector format, the received signal:\n",
    "$$y=\\mathbf{g}^T\\mathbf{x}+n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the transmit vector $\\mathbf{x}$, and divided into two parts:\n",
    "precoding vector $\\mathbf{w}$ that points in the direction of the channel\n",
    "($\\mathbf{g}$ conjugate or $\\mathbf{g^*}$),\n",
    "$\\mathbf{w}=\\frac{\\mathbf{g^*}}{||\\mathbf{g}||}$, and one single information\n",
    "signal $\\tilde{x}$ which have the same energy $q$ per symbol. This\n",
    "process is called Maximum Ration Tranmission (MRT). Then the received signal\n",
    "is:\n",
    "$$y=\\mathbf{g}^T\\mathbf{x}+n=\\mathbf{g}^T\\mathbf{w}\\tilde{x}+n= ||\\mathbf{g}||\\tilde{x}+n.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the channel capacity is exactly the same as in SIMO case:\n",
    "$$log_2\\left(1+\\frac{q||\\mathbf{g}||^2}{N_0}\\right)\\text{ bit/symbol.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "From SIMO and MISO capacity, we can tell that we have roughly\n",
    " $||\\mathbf{g}||^2$ times (proportional to $M$) larger SNR when\n",
    " transmitting from $M$ antennas or receiving using $M$ antennas. However,\n",
    " this gain is achieved in different ways.\n",
    "- When we transmit from $M$ antennas, we are transmitting in a directed\n",
    "way using beamforming towards the user location. This means that the precoding\n",
    "vector with Maximum Ratio Transmission makes sure the $M$ copies of the signal are adding\n",
    "constructively at the receiver side without having more power than before.\n",
    "- When we receive at $M$ antennas, we are actually transmitting from one\n",
    "antennas in the omnidirectional ways, we are observing different copies\n",
    "of it with different channel responses. We add them constructively using\n",
    "Maximum Ratio Combining.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with both transmission or reception using $M$ antennas, we have\n",
    "beamforming gain of $||\\mathbf{g}||^2$ proportional to $M$."
