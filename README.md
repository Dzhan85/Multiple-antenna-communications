## Multiple-antenna-communications
This repo contains multiple antenna communications knowledge with python codes to generate graphs following the [online course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTv48TzNRhaKz0C-dCAwimXSypV_5UTxg) from Communication Systems, Link√∂ping University, LIU.

The repo is provided in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, using libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Numpy for most lessons.

Accompanying the notebooks is a [playlist of lecture videos, available on YouTube]((https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTv48TzNRhaKz0C-dCAwimXSypV_5UTxg)).
